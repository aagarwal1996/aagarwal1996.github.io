I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include machine learning, interpretability, and causal inference.

Previously, I interned as a quantitative researcher at Citadel, and as a research scientist at the Center for Computational Physics at the [Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation](https://simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University.
