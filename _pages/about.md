I am a graduating statistics PhD student at UC Berkeley where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, AI explainability, and causal inference. I received the [Evelyn Fix Prize](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/about/awards-and-honors/student-departmental-awards), awarded for the outstanding dissertation in statistics at Berkeley.

Previously, I interned as a quantitative researcher at Citadel, and as a research scientist at the Center for Computational Physics at the [Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation](https://simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University.
